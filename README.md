# Introduction-to-Structured-Query-Language-SQL
I have provided solutions to the PEER GRADED ASSIGNMENTS of this course.
You can find this course on COURSERA, in which you'll walk through installation steps for installing a text editor, installing MAMP or XAMPP (or equivalent) and creating a MySql Database. You'll learn about single table queries and the basic syntax of the SQL language, as well as database design with multiple tables, foreign keys, and the JOIN operation. Lastly, you'll learn to model many-to-many relationships like those needed to represent users, roles, and courses.
